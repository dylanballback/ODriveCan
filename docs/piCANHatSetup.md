# Raspberry Pi with CAN Hat Setup Page


This page I will go through the componets that I am currently using for my examples and how to set them up.



The waveshare RS485 CAN HAT (~$17) is required to control an O-Drive S1/Pro through CAN Bus with a Raspberry Pi:

The waveshare RS485 CAN HAT is Compatible with Raspberry Pi 4B/3B+/3B/2B/B+/A+/Zero/Zero W/WH/Zero 2W Series Boards.
I am using a Raspberry Pi 2 Zero W but you can use any of the Pi models listed above.






















I would like to thank waveshare for thier documentation and tutorial on how to set this up, you can find the link below:
https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_CAN_HAT

Along with the offical O-Drive Documentation also reiterates how to set up the waveshare RS485 CAN HAT, you can find the link below:
https://docs.odriverobotics.com/v/latest/guides/can-guide.html

You have to scroll down on the O-Drive Documentation Page to "Enable CAN Hat",
then select the "RS4855 / CAN Hat" tab to see instructions on setup.
